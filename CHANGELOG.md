# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Skills**: Claude-Code-style agent-callable Markdown playbooks with three visibility namespaces — `shared/` (all users), `admin/` (admins only), `users/<userId>/` (personal). Lazy loading — only the YAML frontmatter (`name` + one-line `description`) lands in the system prompt, filtered by viewer; full bodies are fetched on demand via the new `skill_invoke` tool. New `skill_install` tool lets the agent create skills on disk with scope-based access control (default: admin → admin scope, user → personal scope). Per-skill resource files supported. Hot reload via chokidar — drop a SKILL.md and the agent sees it without restart. See [docs/SKILLS.md](docs/SKILLS.md) and [examples/skills/](examples/skills/).

## [0.11.2] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- Inline URL and copy buttons inside native Telegram Rich Message paragraphs, including a subtle link style.
- Claude Fable 5.1, GPT-6 Astra, and Gemini 3.8 Flash across their supported native, Codex, and OpenRouter providers.

### Changed

- Simplified CI and release builds by removing redundant SDK and artifact stages and using the published Docker image as the release cache.

### Fixed

- Updated the transitive `fast-uri`, `qs`, and `browserslist` packages to patched versions required by the security audits.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-08-28

### Changed

- Unified user-mode Rich Message text, media, documents, and URL/copy buttons under `telegram_send_message`, with the same structure available for edits.
- Moved embedding inference and vector retrieval to worker threads so RAG no longer blocks Telegram's main event loop.
- Batched Telegram message embeddings and made vector indexing asynchronous after the durable message write.

### Fixed

- Applied chat and message filters inside sqlite-vec KNN queries, excluded the current message, and deduplicated local and cross-chat retrieval results.
- Separated query and document embedding cache entries to preserve Voyage input-type semantics.
- Serialized local query and batch inference in one worker to prevent concurrent ONNX sessions from crashing the agent process.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- Current Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI, Groq, OpenRouter, Kimi, Mistral,
  Cerebras, Z.AI, MiniMax, and Hugging Face models to the shared catalog.
- Provider-scoped compatibility aliases for deprecated or unsupported model IDs.
- Native Telegram Rich Messages for structured text, media, links, quotes, and
  interactive content across user bridges, tools, and the SDK.
- Updated the GramJS fork to 2.33.0 / Telegram MTProto Layer 229 and migrated
  keyboard and inline buttons to the new typed row model.

### Changed

- Updated `@earendil-works/pi-ai` to 0.82.1 and refreshed provider defaults.
- Exposed GPT-5.6 Luna now that Codex advertises it in local and production caches.
- Updated Grok Build to default to Grok 4.6 while retaining Grok 4.5 compatibility.
- Added explicit Codex reasoning-effort configuration, defaulting to `medium`.
- Split `AgentRuntime` and `TeletonApp` into focused turn preparation, loop execution,
  response finalization, message pipeline, and lifecycle components.

### Fixed

- Prevented the WebUI from silently replacing custom or legacy models while loading provider options.
- Switched Mistral Medium to its documented `mistral-medium-latest` API alias.
- Propagated actual Telegram dice results through bot and user bridges, tools, and the SDK.
- Sent Telegram photos as media instead of degrading them to document attachments.
- Consolidated WebUI lifecycle routes and cleaned up SSE listeners across restarts.
- Prevented invalid legacy Telegram message embeddings from disabling vector search during rebuilds.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- Global Telegram account search with filters, page-local sorting, and cursor pagination, plus public channel post/hashtag search with quota preflight and no automatic Stars spending.
- Telegram MTProto Layer 228 compatibility, including the new invite-result union.
- Persistent privacy-bounded agent-turn traces, paged artifacts for large tool results, safe provider/model fallbacks, and a per-turn time budget.
- Turn-scoped idempotency records for external actions.

### Fixed

- Isolated iterative compaction summaries per conversation, preventing one chat summary from entering another chat.
- Persist Telegram admin changes from `/model`, `/loop`, `/policy`, and `/rag` to the validated YAML config before applying them at runtime.
- Removed the unintended `/approve` and `/reject` interruption so authorized actions execute directly.
- Ignore Layer 228 Community pseudo-dialog entities during dialog indexing, preventing `Cannot cast Community` startup errors.
- Return a clear guard-bot WebView result instead of falsely reporting a successfully joined chat.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- **GPT-5.6 Codex support** with Sol and Terra model resolution. Luna support is available only behind `TELETON_ENABLE_CODEX_LUNA=true` for controlled backend revalidation.
- **Validated Grok Build provider** with CLI authentication and runtime checks.
- **Claude Opus 4.8** in the shared model catalog.
- **Plugin SDK 2.1** with typed capability contracts, protected low-level TON sends, get-method execution, DeDust/STON.fi brokers, inline-bot operations, Highload Wallet support, isolated storage/secrets/database access, and explicit approval metadata for external actions.
- SDK package verification, coverage enforcement, and independent npm publication through the release workflow.

### Changed

- Migrated the LLM client from deprecated `@mariozechner/pi-ai` to maintained `@earendil-works/pi-ai`.
- Refactored the agent loop, application startup, onboarding, WebUI contracts, provider policy, DEX/DNS adapters, and SDK type surface into smaller shared modules.
- **Breaking:** raised the supported runtime baseline to Node.js `^22.22.2`, `^24.15.0`, or `>=26.0.0`.
- **Breaking:** removed the obsolete Deals trading module and its stale CLI/WebUI surfaces.
- Plugin execution now enforces SDK capability boundaries, channel scopes, minimum access floors, creator authority for scheduled tasks, and approval gates for external actions.
- CI Telegram notifications now batch every pushed commit into one expandable message.

### Fixed

- Provider quota and runtime failures now produce a clear Telegram error instead of leaving the user without a response.
- Prevented Telegram self-replies, duplicate sends, and false send confirmations; restored bot inline runtime wiring.
- Serialized side-effect operations and bounded stalled MCP/tool calls without retrying non-cancellable financial actions.
- Hardened workspace symlink containment, exec sender allowlists, plugin databases, private reads, log redaction, TON Proxy lifecycle, DEX/DNS transactions, and remote MCP tool trust.
- Bound gift purchases to the approved live price and protected owner-only financial data.
- Replaced eval-based Lottie rendering and pinned patched dependency versions.

### Removed

- Dead helpers, exports, row/media duplicates, and the redundant tool-error wrapper.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- **Native `gocoon` provider**: an OpenAI-compatible, pure-Go COCOON client ([gocoon](https://github.com/TONresistor/gocoon)). Turnkey lifecycle — auto-install and integrity-verify the runner binary, supervise it, and set up / top-up / withdraw the TON payment channel from the CLI (`teleton gocoon`) or the WebUI Gocoon page. Runner pinned to v0.2.0, default model `Qwen/Qwen3-32B`.
- **WebUI Gocoon page**: channel status (including the fund address), top-up, withdraw, unstake, and wallet reset.
- **Codex** in the WebUI provider selector.

### Changed

- **Replaced the `cocoon` provider with `gocoon`** (**Breaking**). Tool-calling now uses the model's native `tools`/`tool_calls` instead of the old XML-injection shim, which has been removed (`src/cocoon/` deleted). Set `agent.provider: gocoon` and rename the `cocoon:` config block to `gocoon:` (`gocoon.port`, default `10000`); legacy `cocoon` configs are auto-migrated on load.
- **ToolSearch mode enabled by default.**
- **Local SSE proxy** fronts the gocoon runner — fixes the pi-ai "empty response / zero tokens" issue and surfaces runner errors to the client.
- **Auto-start is non-fatal**: an unfunded channel keeps the agent and WebUI running so it can be funded from the Gocoon page (requires ≥2 TON free in the fund wallet).
- Re-verify the runner binary integrity on every launch, not only on install.

### Fixed

- **Unstake / withdraw**: `withdrawAll` scanned the owner wallet instead of the fund wallet, so the channel close was skipped and the staked TON stayed locked while only the liquid balance was swept. Now scans the fund address and reads channel state.
- Harden withdraw against transient errors and re-runs (idempotent, re-broadcast-safe).
- Hold the wallet tx-lock during the agent-wallet sweep to prevent a concurrent send from stealing the seqno.
- Gate top-up on a running runner; show the fund address in status.
- CI: lowercase the ghcr.io path in the release-notes Docker step.

### Removed

- The `cocoon` provider and its XML tool-adapter (`src/cocoon/`).
- Dead code: `events/bus`, `memory/agent/sessions`, `telegram/callbacks/*`, web `SearchInput`, `lib/a11y`, and assorted unused helpers.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- **TON Proxy module**: Built-in Tonutils-Proxy lifecycle manager — auto-download binary from GitHub, start/stop, health checks, auto-restart on crash, PID-based orphan cleanup, WebUI API routes for hot-toggle
- **SDK signed transfers**: `createTransfer()`, `createJettonTransfer()`, `getPublicKey()`, `getWalletVersion()` — sign TON/jetton transfers without broadcasting for x402 payment protocol
- **Plugin hooks system**: 13 typed hooks via `sdk.on()` — `message:receive`, `response:before/after/error`, `tool:error`, `prompt:after`, `agent:start/stop`, plus 5 original lifecycle hooks with configurable priority
- **User-configurable hooks**: Keyword blocklist and context triggers for automated responses
- **QR code login**: WebUI setup wizard supports QR code authentication as alternative to phone+code
- **Two-phase observation masking**: Old tool results fully masked, previous iteration results truncated at 4K while preserving summary fields, current iteration intact

### Changed

- **WebUI Config page**: Reorganized into dedicated tabs (Agent, Telegram, TON Proxy, Sessions, Tool RAG)
- **RAG performance**: Knowledge + feed hybrid searches run concurrently via `Promise.all` (~200-500ms saved per message); parsed transcripts cached in memory with invalidation on delete/archive
- **15 LLM providers**: Documentation updated across all `.md` files to reflect Cerebras, ZAI, MiniMax, Hugging Face additions
- **70+ models** in shared catalog (up from 60+)

### Fixed

- **Tool RAG scoring**: Keyword search scores normalized to 1.0 weight when no embedding provider is configured (was incorrectly using 0.4)
- **Transcript deduplication**: `loadContextFromTranscript()` deduplicates `toolResult` messages by `toolCallId`, preventing API 400 errors on corrupted transcripts
- **TON Proxy orphan process**: Manager now writes PID file and checks port occupancy before start, killing orphan processes from previous sessions
- **Security**: Sanitize hook context, fix `effectiveIsGroup` self-reference crash (TDZ)
- **CI**: Coverage thresholds lowered with margin for Node 20 CI variance
- **ESLint**: Strict config with quality tooling and CI hardening

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- **4 new LLM providers** (11 → 15): Cerebras (ultra-fast inference, free tier), ZAI/Zhipu (2 free models), MiniMax (M2.5, 204K ctx), Hugging Face (routing to 18 models via single token)
- **Bot SDK for plugins**: `sdk.bot` with inline query handling, callback routing, colored/styled buttons (success/danger/primary), lazy-loaded, rate-limited, namespace-isolated per plugin
- **29 new SDK methods**: Full Telegram surface (77 tools), TON jetton analytics, dual DEX aggregator, .ton DNS management, scheduled messages, Stars/gift marketplace, `getDialogs`/`getHistory`, `kickUser`
- **`dns.setSiteRecord()`**: Set ADNL records on .ton domains for TON Site hosting
- **GramJS Layer 223**: Participant ranks and message `from_rank` surfaced in agent display

### Changed

- **Moonshot provider**: Refactored from hardcoded model dict to pi-ai native `kimi-coding` provider (30 lines removed). Backward-compat alias maps `kimi-k2.5` → `k2p5`
- **Configurable keys**: Provider list derived from `getSupportedProviders()` instead of hardcoded copy

### Fixed

- **Docker build**: Remove deleted `scripts/` references from Dockerfile; skip husky prepare in runtime stage
- **Release workflow**: Publish-npm and create-release skip gracefully when version already published (idempotent re-push)
- **Security**: NFKC normalization + Unicode Tag Block filtering, SQL comment stripping on plugin DB proxy, download size guard (50MB), deep-clone frozenConfig
- **Performance**: Single shared embedding for context + tool RAG, edges-first chunk reordering, feed truncation (2000 chars)
- **UTC session reset**, transcript permissions, masked API key display

## [0.7.5] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- **YOLO Mode** (Coding Agent): 4 new exec tools for full system access on Linux — `exec_run` (bash commands), `exec_install` (apt/pip/npm/docker), `exec_service` (systemd management), `exec_status` (server health). Disabled by default (`mode: off`), requires explicit `mode: yolo` opt-in. Admin-only scope, configurable timeout (120s), output limit (50KB), full audit trail in SQLite
- **`admin-only` access policy**: New DM and group policy option — only Telegram admins can interact with the agent. Now the default for new installations (previously `open`)
- **DNS set-site tool**: `dns_set_site` links a `.ton` domain to a TON Site via ADNL address for decentralized website hosting
- **GramJS Layer 222 fork**: Switch from npm `telegram` to TONresistor/gramjs fork — native Layer 222 constructors, no more TL schema patching
- **4 NFT marketplace tools** (73 → 77): `get-unique-gift`, `get-unique-gift-value`, `send-gift-offer`, `resolve-gift-offer`
- **Gift service messages**: Real-time handling of gift offers received/declined and gifts received — agent can react automatically
- **TON balance query**: `telegram_get_stars_balance` now supports `ton=true` for internal TON ledger balance
- **Live token usage tracking**: WebUI dashboard displays real-time token consumption with cache hit rates
- **Channel username tools** (70 → 73): `check-channel-username`, `set-channel-username`, `create-channel-username`
- **Toncenter API key**: Centralized TonClient caching with optional Toncenter API key for higher rate limits
- **DB migration 1.12.0**: `exec_audit` table for command execution history (indexed by timestamp, user)
- **DB migration 1.13.0**: Per-session token usage tracking (input/output tokens accumulated per chat)
- **Session auto-pruning**: Sessions older than 30 days are automatically cleaned up at startup

### Changed

- **Tool RAG enabled by default**: Semantic tool selection now active for all providers, reducing ~120 tools to ~25 per LLM call
- **35+ tool descriptions enriched**: Cross-references and clearer context for better RAG matching accuracy
- **Default access policy**: DM and group policies default to `admin-only` instead of `open` — secure by default
- **CLI wizard**: New "Coding Agent" setup question, policy choices reordered (Admin Only first)
- **WebUI wizard**: New "System Execution" select with YOLO mode + VPS warning
- **Dashboard**: Policy selects updated with `admin-only` option and clearer labels
- **Gift catalog rework**: `get-available-gifts` now supports pagination, sorting (price, resale count), search by title, and resale filter
- **Resale identifiers**: `buy-resale-gift` migrated from `odayId` to `slug`, `set-collectible-price` from `odayId` to `msgId`
- **Resale error handling**: `STARGIFT_RESELL_TOO_EARLY` parsed with human-readable wait time, `STARGIFT_INVALID` with guidance
- **Styled keyboard**: Native Layer 222 constructors for `KeyboardButtonStyle`, `KeyboardButtonCopy`, `KeyboardButtonCallback` — no more `(Api as any)` casts
- **WebUI dashboard**: Redesigned with provider switch, tools & plugins panels
- **WebUI config page**: Harmonized UX across all settings panels
- **Ston.fi DEX**: Migrated to SDK v2 with hardened SendMode and transaction locking

### Fixed

- **Typing indicator**: Persistent typing during agent processing with retry and dedup hardening
- **Auth flow**: Guard `SentCodePaymentRequired` type (Layer 222 narrowing) in both CLI and WebUI auth
- **send-gift**: Use `getInputEntity()` instead of `getEntity()` for correct InputPeer type

### Removed

- **Postinstall patch system**: `scripts/patch-gramjs.sh` and `scripts/postinstall.mjs` — no longer needed with Layer 222 fork

## [0.7.4] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- **Configurable keys overhaul**: Array type support (admin_ids, allow_from, group_allow_from), labels and option labels on all keys, new keys for Telegram rate limits, Deals params, Embedding model, Cocoon port, Agent base_url
- **ArrayInput component**: Tag-style input for managing array config values in the dashboard
- **Memory sources browser**: List indexed knowledge sources with entry counts, expand to view individual chunks with line ranges
- **Workspace image preview**: Serve raw images with correct MIME type, 5MB limit, SVG sandboxing
- **Tool RAG persistence**: RAG config (enabled, topK, alwaysInclude, skipUnlimitedProviders) now persists to YAML
- **Tasks bulk clean**: Clean tasks by terminal status (done, failed, cancelled) instead of just done
- **GramJS bot session persistence**: Save/load MTProto session string to avoid re-auth on restart

### Changed

### Fixed

- **Plugins route**: WebUI now reflects runtime-loaded plugins instead of static config

## [0.7.1] - 2026-02-23

### Added

- **Agent Run/Stop control**: Separate agent lifecycle from WebUI — start/stop the agent at runtime without killing the server. New `AgentLifecycle` state machine (`stopped/starting/running/stopping`), REST endpoints (`POST /api/agent/start`, `/stop`, `GET /api/agent/status`), SSE endpoint (`GET /api/agent/events`) for real-time state push, `useAgentStatus` hook (SSE + polling fallback), and `AgentControl` sidebar component with confirmation dialog
- **MCP Streamable HTTP transport**: `StreamableHTTPClientTransport` as primary transport for URL-based MCP servers, with automatic fallback to `SSEClientTransport` on failure. `mcpServers` list is now a lazy function for live status. Resource cleanup (AbortController, sockets) on fallback. Improved error logging with stack traces

### Fixed

- **WebUI setup wizard**: Neutralize color accent overuse — selection states, warning cards, tag pills, step dots all moved to neutral white/grey palette; security notice collapsed into `<details>`; "Optional Integrations" renamed to "Optional API Keys"; bot token marked as "(recommended)"
- **Jetton send**: Wrap entire `sendJetton` flow in try/catch for consistent `PluginSDKError` propagation; remove `SendMode.IGNORE_ERRORS` (errors are no longer silently swallowed); fix `||` → `??` on jetton decimals (prevents `0` decimals being replaced by `9`)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **WebUI Setup Wizard**: 6-step guided onboarding flow (Welcome, Provider, Telegram, Config, Wallet, Connect) with shared Shell sidebar layout, React context state management, server-side validation mirror, and "Start Agent" button with seamless setup-to-dashboard transition
- **Local LLM Provider**: New "local" provider for OpenAI-compatible servers (Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio, llama.cpp) with auto-model discovery from `/models` endpoint, CLI `--base-url` option, and WebUI provider card
- `getEffectiveApiKey()` helper for consistent API key resolution across all LLM call sites
- ASCII banner for `teleton setup --ui` matching `teleton start`
- 86 setup route tests + 39 validation tests (898 total tests)

### Fixed

- **Security audit remediation (27 fixes)**: MCP env var blocklist, sendStory symlink-safe path validation (realpathSync), DB ATTACH/DETACH proxy for plugin isolation, BigInt float precision (string-based decimals), debounce clamp, SendMode.IGNORE_ERRORS removed, URL quote escaping, wallet JSON validation, pino redact, and more
- `fetchWithTimeout` (10s) + http/https scheme validation on local model discovery
- Model array capped to 500 entries to prevent unbounded growth
- Early exit when provider=local but `base_url` missing
- Non-interactive onboarding: relaxed `--api-key` for local/cocoon providers
- WebUI UX: CSS specificity fixes, bot token inline field, wallet address prominent display, TonAPI/Tavily as plain optional fields

## Note — 2026-02-21
